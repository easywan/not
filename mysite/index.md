<p>
  I am a PhD student in the Interaction Lab at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). 
</p>
<p>  
  My current research interest is to enhance user experience in multisensory media. 
  In many cases, sensory effects such as motion or vibration are assumed to be good if added, but in fact, it may not be the case. 
  It can backfire if they are poorly designed in the first place, or if they are out of harmony with the other elements. 
  Above all, it is not yet clear in which situations each effect is particularly effective. 
  I am interested in designing and authoring of these sensory effects, taking into account the characteristics of human perception in which sensory noises are inevitable to some extent.
  I hope that my results would be useful to the research or knowledge of others.
